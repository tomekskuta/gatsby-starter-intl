# :bullettrain_side: Gatsby starter intl :airplane:

Gatsby v2 i18n starter based on [Gatsby Starter Default](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default) and [gatsby-starter-default-intl](https://github.com/wiziple/gatsby-starter-default-intl).
Gatsby creates static pages for every language and detects your browser locale. That rocks! :guitar:

## How to start

To start use **Gatsby starter intl** you have to install Gatsby CLI

```sh
npm install global gatsby-cli
or
yarn global add gatsby-cli
```

Then use it to start new project based on **Gatsby starter intl**

```sh
gatsby new your-project-name https://github.com/tomekskuta/gatsby-starter-intl
cd your-project-name/
gatsby develop
```

Your site is running at `localhost:8000`.

If you want to compile your production build just run `gatsby build`. That's easy.

Start build your great i18n Gatsby app! :rocket:

## How it works

Gatsby creates **static pages** for every language sets in `src/i18n/languages.js`.
It looks like `/en/page-2` and `/pl/page-2`. Google loves it - they said.

Translations are set in `src/i18n/locales/`. For better navigation I prefer create files for every page. Unfortunately react-intl supports only flat objects so in `src/i18n/locales/chosen-lang/index.js` I used [flat](https://github.com/hughsk/flat). Don't forget to import your translate file into `index.js` in the same directory.
Then if I want to get translation for `Welcome to page 2` on `page-2` I do it like this:

```jsx
<FormattedMessage id="page2.Welcome to page 2" />
```

TODO:

- write good docz.
- connect SEO component with some intl magic
- refactor to better names and remove unnecessary code.
- :nail_care: style locale buttons to look pretty and stylish :high_heel:

### Default starter's docs:

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (STARTER) -->

Kick off your project with this default boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

_Have another more specific idea? You may want to check out our vibrant collection of [official and community-created starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/)._

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    npx gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-default-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
